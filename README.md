## Objective
Our goal is to predict probability of converting a client as a result of marketing campaign initiatives. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y). 

In addition to predictive modelling, we have also worked on uplift modelling (prescriptive modelling) to estimate the impact of an company action on customer outcome. 

## About the data
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
